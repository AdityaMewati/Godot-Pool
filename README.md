# Godot-Pool
A simple singleplayer pool game. Made as an easy side project to do in my freetime. Although, I no longer work on it (lost interest). Right not it's very barebones, it doesn't even keep track of the game right now. Ideally, it would tell you which balls are sunk and other game specific states.

Currently there is no multiplayer but if I ever revisit this I'll add it.
